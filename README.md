A mathematical compartmental transmission model for RSV

We developed a dynamic compartmental model of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) fitted to individually-linked population-based laboratory, perinatal and hospitalisation data for 2000-2012 from metropolitan Western Australia (WA), stratified by age and prior exposure. We account for the differential risk of RSV-hospitalisation in full-term and preterm infants (defined as <37 weeks gestation). We formulated a function relating age, RSV exposure history, and preterm status to the risk of RSV-hospitalisation given infection. Further details of this work can be found xx.
